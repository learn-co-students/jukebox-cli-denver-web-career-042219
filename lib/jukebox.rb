  # - help : displays this help message

  # - play : lets you choose a song to play

# This method takes in an argument of the songs array of puts out the following:

  # 1. Phoenix - 1901
  # 2. Tokyo Police Club - Wait Up
  # 3. Sufjan Stevens - Too Much
  # 4. The Naked and the Famous - Young Blood

#list(songs)

# THE PLAY METHOD
# This method also takes in an argument of the songs array. It first puts out the prompt: "Please enter a song name or number:". It then stores the user's response using gets.chomp.

# If the user's response is a valid song number or song name, the method should puts out: "Playing <song name>". Otherwise, it should puts out: "Invalid input, please try again".

# THE RUN METHOD
# This method is a little trickier. It will use the other methods we built, our "helper" methods, to actually enact the running of our Jukebox.

# First, this method should call on the help method to show the user the available commands. Then, it should puts out the prompt: "Please enter a command:". It should capture the user's response using gets.chomp or gets.strip.

# We need to keep our program running as long as the user's input is not "exit". Use a loop to continue asking the user for input until or unless their input is "exit". Use if or case statements to determine how your program will respond to a user's input. For example, if their input is "list", call the list method, if their input is "play", call the play method, if their input is "help", call the help method and if their input is "exit", call the exit_jukebox method and break out of your loop to stop the program.
